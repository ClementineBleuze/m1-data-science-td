It is based on the book of the same name by Jon Krakauer. It is the story of Christopher McCandless, a man who hiked across North America in the early 1990s. The film stars Emile Hirsch as McCandless and Marcia Gay Harden and William Hurt as his parents. It also includes several other stars, like Jena Malone, Catherine Keener, Brian Dierker, Vince Vaughn, Kristen Stewart, and Hal Holbrook. The movie was released during the 2007 Rome Film Fest. It was nominated for two Golden Globes and won the award for Best Original Song: ""Guaranteed"" by Eddie Vedder. It was also nominated for two Academy Awards: Best Editing and Best Supporting actor for Holbrook. In April 1992, Christopher McCandless arrives in a remote area north of the Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska. McCandless is unprepared. The stranger who drops him off lends him a pair of boots. McCandless sets up a campsite in an abandoned city bus. He calls the bus ""The Magic Bus."" At first, McCandless is content with the isolation, the beauty of nature around him, and the thrill of living off the land. He hunts with a rifle and reads books. He writes down his thoughts as he prepares for a new life in the wild. Two years earlier, in May 1990, McCandless graduated from Emory University with honors. Shortly afterwards, he destroyed all of his credit cards and documents. He donates nearly all of his savings to Oxfam and sets out on a cross-country drive to experience life in the wilderness. McCandless does not tell his parents, Walt and Billie McCandless, or his sister Carine, what he is doing or where he is going. He refuses to keep in touch with them after his departure. At Lake Mead, McCandless' car is caught in a flash flood, causing him to abandon it and begin hiking. He burns what remains of his cash and assumes a new name: ""Alexander Supertramp."" In Northern California, McCandless meets a hippie couple named Jan Burres and Rainey. Rainey tells McCandless about his failing relationship with Jan. In September, McCandless arrives in Carthage, South Dakota. He is forced to leave after being arrested for using satellite dishes. He then travels on a river trip. He is told by park rangers that he may not kayak down the river without a license. He ignores the rangers' warnings and swims downriver until he arrives in Mexico. There, his kayak is lost in a dust storm and he crosses back into the United States on foot. Unable to hitch a ride, he travels on freight trains to Los Angeles. Not long after arriving, he starts feeling abandoned and decides to leave. Later, he is forced to continue hitchhiking after he is beaten by police. In December 1991, McCandless arrives at Slab City, in the Imperial Valley. There, he also meets Tracy Tatro. She is a teenage girl who shows interest in McCandless, but he does not want to accept her because she is underage. After the holidays, McCandless decides to leave for Alaska. McCandless meets Ron Franz, a retired man who tells him about the loss of his family in a car accident while he was serving in the U.S. Army. He now spends his time in a workshop as an amateur leather worker. Franz teaches McCandless the craft of leatherwork, and he makes a belt that details McCandless' travels. After spending two months with Franz, McCandless decides to leave for Alaska. This upsetting Franz, who has become quite close to McCandless. On a final note, Franz gives McCandless his old camping and travel gear. He also offers McCandless his offer to adopt him as his grandchild. Four months later, life for McCandless becomes harder. He must make several poor decisions. As his supplies dwindle, he realizes that nature is also harsh. McCandless believes that happiness can only be found when shared with others. He returns from the wild to his friends and family. However, he finds that the stream he had crossed during the winter has become wide, deep, and violent. Unable to cross it, he returns to the bus. In a desperate act, McCandless is forced to gather and eat roots and plants. He falls sick as a result. Slowly dying, he continues to write about his journey. He writes a farewell to the world and imagines his family for the last time. He writes a farewell to the world and crawls into his sleeping bag to die. Two weeks later, his body is found by hunters. Shortly afterwards, Carine McCandless returns to Virginia with her brother's ashes in her backpack.
